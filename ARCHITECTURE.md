## System architecture

Ton developers team works with a massive amount of products and options. So the best way to handle them is to get and find complete information about the system architecture.

So let's start with the central system architecture.

The central system architecture looks like many microservices working together or separately to provide the best onboarding guide and user experience.

The main goal of every product is to onboard and share the knowledge of all web3 and crypto industry to future users.
